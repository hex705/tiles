These files are TEMPLATES -- not complete EXAMPLES.

Many WORK as is, some cannot because they weave multiple CONCEPTs together. For example SCISSORS examples in PROCESSING need a STREAMs.  Streams are handled with other templates.  You need to weave the necessary STREAM code into the SCISSORS setup for it to come together.

If you have problems or find errors (there are bound to be some) please let me know.
