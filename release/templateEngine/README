The script depends on JS-Beautify.

It can be installed using PIP

sudo pip install jsbeautify 

or 
run the installer from the jsbeautifier folder:

cd jsbeautifier
sudo python setup.py install 



The data folder contains the XML code templates.

The rsync script syncs the CGI script and the data to deadpixel.ca/tiles, but requires a 
password.
